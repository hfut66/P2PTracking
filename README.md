# Smart Surgical Telementoring System with Patch-to-Pixel Point Tracking Method

The paper is under review. This repository provides **P2PTracking** algorithm, [MICCAI 2019 sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01133), [Chloec80](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03012) and other datasets. The datasets are available at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VlqMEdN5RIFDkMbE9XWdAKfqmOjISEKJ?usp=sharing).

## Demos

You can demo the P2PTracking algorithm on a sequence of images, run
```Shell
python main.py
```


## Visualization
Here we show some results of the proposed **P2PTracking** algorithm on [Chloec80](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03012),hysterectomy surgery vedio and laparoscopic pelvic mass excision surgery vedio
